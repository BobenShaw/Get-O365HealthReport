User Impact: Affected admins were unable to execute some provisioning workflows.

More info: Affected admins were receiving an error within the provisioning page of the admin portal when attempting to assign licenses to users, or move users in or out of a group with the affected SKUs. Impact was predominately to groups and users with E3 licenses, though other license types may have also have been affected.

Final status: We've deployed a fix that removes the dependency on MyAnalytics and we've confirmed that impact has been remediated.

Scope of impact: This issue may have potentially affected any admins attempting to assign licenses or manage groups with the affected SKUs.

User Impact: Users were unable to make and receive calls or join conference calls.

More info: Impact was predominantly to users leveraging Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when connecting to conference calls; however, connection attempts made outside PSTN may have failed in some scenarios.

Final status: While monitoring the service following the event communicated under LY172785, we detected a brief increase in latency that may have resulted in call failures or degradation to other Skype for Business services. We intervened and applied targeted configuration updates to mitigate any impact, and our telemetry confirms that the service is healthy.

Scope of impact: This issue could have potentially affected any of your users.

Start time: Tuesday, February 5, 2019, at 3:00 PM UTC

End time: Tuesday, February 5, 2019, at 3:15 PM UTC

Preliminary root cause: A recent update to components that facilitate communication between some back-end services leveraged by Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams adversely affected how our service handles calling and conferencing traffic during peak hours.

Next steps:
- We?re continuing to monitor service performance and are reviewing additional potential automated recovery options to reduce or avoid similar impact in the future.
